# Chatbot - A Love-Hate Relationship

Welcome to the **Chatbot Reservation System**, where dreams are made, and bugs are crushed under the weight of endless debug sessions!

## What's Happening Here?

This chatbot helps you make reservations... if you don’t mind a little chaos. It handles multiple languages, remembers your name (unless it forgets), and tries its best to guide you through the reservation process. But like any good bot, it occasionally has an existential crisis. 

## How to Run (Prepare for Emotional Turmoil):

1. Clone the repository (because, let’s face it, you’ve probably tried everything else first).
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pxncho99/ChatBotNLP.git
   cd ChatBotNLP
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment. It’s like a safe space for your code.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the environment. It’s like waking the bot up from a nap.
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install dependencies. These are the things that make the bot “almost” work.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Bot

Start the bot, watch it do its thing (and crash occasionally). Don’t worry; it happens to the best of us.
```bash
python app.py
```

Then, open your browser and try not to panic when things go wrong:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## What You’ll Get

1. **A Great Chatbot Experience** – (when it's not throwing errors)
2. **Multiple Languages** – Because why not make things even more confusing?
3. **Sessions** – To remember your mistakes. 
4. **GIFs and Audio** – To cover up the fact that nothing works perfectly.

## Final Thoughts

Building this chatbot has been a journey of self-doubt, endless coffee, and, of course, handling edge cases that you *definitely* didn’t foresee. But when it works, it’s pure magic! Until the next bug comes in...

Good luck. You’ll need it.
